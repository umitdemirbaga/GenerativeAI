# GenerativeAI

This repository includes two key datasets: First, the original_data(normalised).csv file comprises the foundational dataset sourced directly from a cloud-based Hadoop cluster, representing the raw and unaltered data captured from the system. 
This dataset serves as the primary source of information for analysis and insights. 
Second, the generated_data(normalised).csv file contains the synthesised dataset crafted by a generative model. 
This generated dataset has been subjected to normalisation procedures, which ensures uniformity and standardisation across its features.
